## Clojure Challenge

It was very exciting and fun journey trying to learn this new language, honestly it was my first touch to this kind of programming and concepts, so if you see any bad practices or bad code, please let me know, I would love to learn more about it. <3

### How to run

Basically I just ran all the codes in the REPL terminal, loading the files:


#### Point 1

I wrote a separated file for the first point, so you can run it like this:

```clojure
~/clojure-challenge$ clj
Clojure 1.10.1

user=> (load-file "invoice_conditions.clj")
```

#### Point 2

Here, I wasn't able to achieve the goal of the challenge, but I was very close to it. I'll be very happy if you can give me some feedback about it.

```clojure
~/clojure-challenge$ clj -A:deps
Clojure 1.10.1

user=> (load-file "invoice_spec.clj")
```

#### Point 3

Here I just ran the tests in the IntelliJ IDE, but you can run it like this:

```clojure
~/clojure-challenge$ clj -A:deps
Clojure 1.10.1

user=> (load-file "invoice_item.clj")
```

## Thank you!
